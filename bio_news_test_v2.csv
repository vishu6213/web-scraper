He brings a wealth of experience in driving corporate growth, innovation, global expansion, and organizational scaling. Venkat has held key leadership roles at companies including Vyome Therapeutics Inc., Vyome Biosciences Private Limited, Emami Ltd., Aurobindo Pharma, Shantha Biotechnics (a Sanofi company), and CavinKare. In an exclusive interview with Rahul Koul, Chief Editor, BioVoice News, Venkat Nelabhotla, Co-Founder, President, and CEO of Vyome Holdings, Inc. shared his insights on the company’s long-term vision, its current focus areas, R&D efforts and future outlook. Vyome Holdings operates at the intersection of immuno-inflammatory disease biology, orphan indications, and emerging digital technologies. What was the original vision for the company, and how has it evolved over time? Vyome was founded to advance science-led therapies for conditions with significant unmet medical needs. Over time, the company’s strategy has evolved to reflect operational experience, capital availability, regulatory considerations, and market conditions. Today, Vyome Holdings is focused on a more selective portfolio approach, emphasizing specialty and orphan indications and leveraging global development capabilities where appropriate. This evolution reflects a pragmatic alignment of scientific goals with execution and capital discipline. As CEO of a public biotechnology company, how do you approach balancing longer-term research goals with near-term operational and financial considerations? Biotechnology development requires balancing scientific ambition with responsible capital management. Our approach is to prioritize programs based on unmet need, available data, regulatory pathways, and resource requirements. Decisions are made with an understanding of current constraints and are revisited as new information becomes available. As a public company, transparency and prudent financial management are central to how we operate. Can you describe Vyome Holdings’ current pipeline and the clinical or development activities the company is presently focused on? Vyome’s current pipeline includes clinical-stage and preclinical assets targeting immuno-inflammatory and specialty conditions. One of the company’s lead programs, VT-1953, is being evaluated for treating symptoms of malignant fungating wounds, a condition with no FDA-approved drugs, and has a multi-billion addressable market and a potential orphan drug designation in the USA. The Company has announced successful and positive phase 2 results for this program. The company also continues development work on VT-1908 for steroid-sparing uveitis, which has a multi-billion dollar addressable market. and is assessing additional opportunities consistent with its strategic focus. Progression of any program is subject to ongoing evaluation, regulatory interaction, and resource considerations. How does Vyome’s portfolio aim to address areas where existing treatment options may be limited or inadequate? Vyome’s development efforts are directed toward conditions where existing therapies may not adequately address disease burden or patient quality of life. The company’s focus is on identifying biological mechanisms that may offer alternative approaches to treatment. While these efforts are intended to address unmet needs, clinical benefit and regulatory outcomes cannot be assured and are subject to further study. Innovation in immune-inflammation and specialty therapeutics can face adoption challenges. How has Vyome approached stakeholder engagement around novel programs? Vyome’s approach emphasizes data-driven communication and early engagement with relevant stakeholders, including regulators, clinicians, and potential partners. Acceptance of novel therapies typically depends on clinical evidence, safety, and clearly defined benefit-risk profiles. The company seeks to align development plans with established regulatory expectations and evolving clinical standards. What scientific or regulatory considerations are most relevant in advancing immuno-inflammatory and orphan therapies? Programs in these areas often involve complex biology, specialized clinical endpoints, and evolving regulatory frameworks. Key considerations include appropriate study design, selection of clinically meaningful endpoints, and ensuring product quality and consistency. Regulatory expectations may vary by indication and geography, and ongoing dialogue with regulatory authorities is an important part of the development process. What guidance would you offer to emerging biotech entrepreneurs, particularly those seeking to build science-led companies in India? Entrepreneurs should focus on clearly defined unmet needs, develop a strong understanding of regulatory and development pathways, and remain mindful of capital efficiency. Building global perspectives early—across science, regulation, and execution—can be helpful. Long-term success typically requires persistence, disciplined execution, and the ability to adapt strategy as circumstances change. What factors are likely to influence Vyome Holdings’ direction over the coming years? Vyome’s future direction will be influenced by clinical data, regulatory interactions, financing conditions, and broader market dynamics. The company will continue to evaluate its programs and strategic options based on available information and resources. Any forward-looking statements regarding development timelines, outcomes, or impact are subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in biotechnology development.
