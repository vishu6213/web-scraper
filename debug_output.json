  "content": "4:14High Drama In Karnataka Assembly As Governor Walks Out Over Speech ControversyThis special report covers the unprecedented scenes inside the Karnataka Assembly where the Governor staged a walkout. The incident occurred during the customary address at the beginning of the session, where the Governor is expected to read a speech prepared by the state government. According to the report, 'There's been a big controversy over the mention of the G. Ramji Bill in the speech of the Governor, which he refused to, in fact, read out as is customary.' The Governor reportedly refused to read the speech as drafted due to the inclusion of the G. Ramji Bill. While initial indications suggested he might only skip that specific portion, the Governor ultimately exited the floor of the house. The walkout was accompanied by chaos as BJP and JDS MLAs also left the assembly. The Chief Minister was seen addressing the press following the incident, which highlights a direct confrontation between the Governor and the state government in Karnataka.",
  "description": "An unidentified speaker has launched a scathing attack on the state Governor, accusing the office of acting as a 'puppet in the hands of the union government'. The speaker alleged that the Governor violated Sections 176 and 163 of the Constitution by refusing to read the speech prepared by the cabinet, opting instead to read only a single paragraph. 'The governor didn't read the speech given by the cabinet and he wanted to read his own speech,' the speaker stated, labeling the move as unethical and unconstitutional. The address also focused on the dilution of the MGNREGA scheme, referred to as 'Manreka', noting that the right to work and local panchayat powers have been abolished under new central tenets. The speaker confirmed that party MLAs and MLCs will launch state-wide protests until the 'anti-farmer' policies are repealed and the original employment guarantees are reinstated, asserting that the opposition is intentionally defending these changes due to a lack of freedom.",
